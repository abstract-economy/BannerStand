# Philosophy (Most important part!)
The fact that I could build my own software over another piece of software _that I do not own i.e. not open-source_ is very intriguing to me. I was able to build my own layer, extend existing sofware by adding new features to it without asking for permission or knowing any information about the codebase of that software. Pretty powerful stuff. I think there's a lot of useful applications that can be leveraged from that concept. Perhaps we can add an encryption layer on top of Facebook to prevent Facebook from understanding our data? Also, building extensions for browsers is cool, why can't we build extensions for native software?

## Function
A browser extension to help students at my university plan their courses for the upcoming semester.
- View information for multiple courses at the same time using a grid layout of draggable course cards.
- Build their schedule in minutes by leveraging the responsive time conflict detection feature (pick a section time for a course, all sections from other courses with a time conflict are crossed out).
- Used by 350 students during course registration periods.

## Stack
- Node.js for backend
- MongoDB for storage
- React and Redux for frontend

## First ever product!
The server code is monolithic and non-modularized. Literally one file has everything :) But that's understandable because this is my first piece of software that I build for others to use.
